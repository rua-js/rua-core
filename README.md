# RUA CORE
Rua Core provides easier way to manage Rua Adaptors, 
and expose them in a single global variable for use.

## What is Rua
Rua.js series' goal is to wrap lots of great javascript libraries,
to make them much more easier to use.

You can simply treat it as an adaptor.

## Philosophy of Rua
No matter what method we use to make great libraries even greater,

We do not change the original usage of libraries, we enhance it.

Normally, We develop Rua.js for reasons like:

1. We want to write less code in our development
2. We want to access some methods or variables that is not accessible from original library
3. We want to enhance the libraries for our own reason, but there is not api for it

We do not fork or copy the source code,
we use a destructive or non-destructive Adaptor to achieve this.
